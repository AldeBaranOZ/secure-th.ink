      <description>Hello World! (Again)
I was reading someone&amp;rsquo;s blog yesterday and thinking just how lucky they were to have a working blog and then I reminded myself that I also have a blog - it is just not working. So I configured it and I now have the ability to blog once more.
My first blog was created way back in the Golden Age of blogging and I actually like some of the content on it.</description>
